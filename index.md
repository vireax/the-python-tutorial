# The Python Tutorial

I'm translating these tutorial into Khmer language.

Original text: [http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient
high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-
oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together
with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid
application development in many areas on most platforms.

The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available
in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site,
[http://www.python.org/](http://www.python.org/), and may be freely
distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many
free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional
documentation.

The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types
implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also
suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.

This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and
features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python
interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-
contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.

For a description of standard objects and modules, see [_The Python Standard
Library_](../library/index.html#library-index). [_The Python Language
Reference_](../reference/index.html#reference-index) gives a more formal
definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read [_Extending
and Embedding the Python Interpreter_](../extending/index.html#extending-
index) and [_Python/C API Reference Manual_](../c-api/index.html#c-api-index).
There are also several books covering Python in depth.

This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single
feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of
Python's most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the
language's flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and
write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about
the various Python library modules described in [_The Python Standard
Library_](../library/index.html#library-index).

## About this translation

I speak English and Python not really perfectly. So, I only hope that other people can improve their skill better than mine after reading this book.
